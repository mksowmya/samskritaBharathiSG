<p>Samskrita Bharati of India extended its wings to Singapore in 2010 as a student led endeavor to promote and facilitate Samskrita (Sanskrit) Language Studies in  Singapore.  The  Singapore  branch  of  Samskrita  Bharati  was established in 2016 and is run by a group of dedicated volunteers. It is run on a non-profit basis with the intention of extending the Samskrita Study facilities to all sections of the society in Singapore.
Through the relentless efforts of its pioneering batch of students, Samskrita Bharati is now witnessing a  significant growth in the number of students enrolling for Samskrita Studies. The Ramakrishna Mission,   Singapore provides invaluable help to the  Samskrita  Bharati  in  its  efforts  by  allowing  the  use  of  its  venue and facilities for conducting weekend lessons  for  its  growing  number  of  students.  At  present  Samskrita  Bharati primarily offers three kinds of programs for Samskrita Studies.</p>

<p>The first program is a four-level language course in which the first level “Pravesha” is aimed at complete  beginners. Samskrita Bharati conducts weekend lessons for these  levels at the Ramakrishna Mission,  Bartley  Road. Adults of all ages and children from the age  of  twelve  (12)  are  encouraged  to  take  part  in  these  courses. Exams are conducted every February and August to  assess  the  progress  of  the  students.  Upon successful completion of examination, the students progress to the  next  level.  To  inculcate  learning  of Samskrita from an early age, Samskrita Bharati conducts special classes called “Balakendram”.</p>

<p>The second program called “Shatavaktaarah”  is  built  for  fostering  conversation  skills  and  was  started  with the stated aim of developing at least one  hundred  (100)  students  who  are  proficient  in  Samskrita  conversation. This program provides a platform for students to practice Samskrita conversation by presenting various types of entertainment  programs  like  plays,  songs,  discussions,  news  and  short  talks  on  various  topics  in Samskrita.</p>

<p>The third program called “Samskrita Parichaya Shibiram”, is a 16-hour interactive workshop which aims to introduce and teach basic constructs of Samskrita to complete beginners. At the end of the workshop, the participants are able to converse in basic Samskrita.  With  its  emphasis  on  Samskrita  conversation,  the  program is also useful for advanced students who wish to improve their conversation skills.  Starting  from  January  2018, this  program  will  be offered every month  as a 2-day  program  in different parts of Singapore.     To reach out to and engage more communities of Singapore, the workshop will be held at different locations each month.</p>

<p>Along with providing Samskrita language training to its students, Samskrita Bharati also trains its volunteer teachers in methods of conducting  the  workshops.  A  10-day  teachers’  training  workshop  was  recently  held for this purpose where a Samskrita Bharati scholar from Bangalore, India was invited to train the teachers. Similar workshops will be held on an annual basis.</p>
